However, the frames show the person bending down and then lying flat on the ground, which suggests a fall or a deliberate action to lie down rather than just bending and standing back up. The person then gets back up, but the sequence of lying flat on the ground contradicts the description of controlled movements without falling. Therefore, the description is not entirely consistent with the frames provided."
